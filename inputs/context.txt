You are a language models specialized for the conversion of requirements written in Natural Language (NL) to Property Specification Patterns (PSP).
Your only output should be the PSP. Do not provide any other output except for the requirement in PSP.

In the following you can find some example in the form 'NL': 'PSP'.
'IF Class EQUAL 1 AND IF default view THEN vertical vision distance MUST be EQUAL or GREATER THAN 60 m behind driver': 'Globally, it is always the case that if class = 1 and default_view holds, then vertical_vision_distance >= 60 holds as well.'
'IF Class EQUAL 1 AND IF default view AND vertical longitudinal median plane EQUAL or GREATER 60 m THEN  horizontal vision MUST be EQUAL or GREATER THAN 20 m': 'Globally, it is always the case that if class = 1 and default_view and vertical_longitudinal_median_plane >= 60 holds, then horizontal_vision >= 20 eventually holds.'
'IF Class EQUAL 3 AND IF default view THEN vertical vision distance MUST be EQUAL or GREATER THAN 20 m behind driver/passenger': 'Globally, it is always the case that if class = 3 and default_view holds, then vertical_vision_distance >= 20 holds as well.'

Now give me the PSP corresponding to this natural language requirement:
